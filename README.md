DESCRIPTION
- 
A motorised belt conveyor designed for slow, light-duty, short-distance transport tasks within small-scale environments. It operates at low voltage and includes integrated control components for ease of use and safety.

The built-in photoelectric sensor automatically halts the belt when an object is detected and restarts it once the path is clear. 

***Note**: Transparent or highly reflective objects may not be reliably detected by the sensor.*

APPLICATIONS
- 
Moving small objects.
